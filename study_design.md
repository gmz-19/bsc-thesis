###### BSc Thesis: "How Are Different Asynchronous Programming Constructs in JavaScript Related to Software Quality? A Repository Mining Study on GitHub"

##### Mining Software Repository (MSR)

This research conducts a mining software repository (MSR) study. The source of open-source repositories is GitHub, a network-based version management service for software development projects.
The goal is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects using the vast amounts of software data.

## Research Questions

1. How do asynchronous programming constructs affect software quality?
1.1 Do JavaScript applications using callbacks lead to less software quality?
1.2 Do JavaScript applications using async/await lead to less software quality?
1.3 Do JavaScript applications that use "promises" show better software quality?

## Object Selection

- [ ] GitHub as source of open-source code
- [ ] GitHub API for selecting and downloading code
- [ ] 

## Sampling Strategy

- [ ] Setting constraints and requirements for selecting repositories
- [ ] Writing sctipt to automate the sampling

### Constraints for repositories

- [ ] the primary programming language should be min. 60% JavaScript (because applications always have content of other languages, like HTML, CSS, XML, or additional backend),
- [ ] a repository is not necessarily a project,
- [ ] must have modified in the last year at least once (to avoid analyzing inactive repositories),
- [ ] must have more than 10,000 lines of code,
- [ ] must have at least ten stars,
- [ ] 

- [ ] Set relevant metrics
  - [ ] a repo is not necessarily a project,
  - [ ] few/more commits,
  - [ ] stars,
  - [ ] contributors,
  - [ ] activity,
  - [ ] period of time,
  - [ ] primary programming language = min. 60% JS (because applications always have content of other languages, like HTML, CSS, XML, or additional backend)
- [ ] How to find asynchronous programming constructs in repos

## Data Collection Procedures

- [ ] Define software quality metrics
- [ ] Which API for extraction data from GitHub

## Analysis Procedures

- [ ] Which tools for analysis
- [ ] Benchmark of tools which to use
- [ ] Advantages and Disadvantages of a tool and their measuring metrics

## Validty Procedures

- [ ] ?
