###### BSc Thesis: "How Are Different Asynchronous Programming Constructs in JavaScript Related to Software Quality? A Repository Mining Study on GitHub"

##### Mining Software Repository (MSR)

This research conducts a mining software repository (MSR) study. The source of open-source repositories is GitHub, a network-based version management service for software development projects.
The goal is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects using the vast amounts of software data.

## Research Questions

#### RQ1: "What are common bug patterns of using asynchronous programming constructs in JavaScript?"

#### RQ2: "How do asynchronous programming constructs affect software quality?"
1. Do JavaScript applications using "callbacks" lead to less software quality?
2. Do JavaScript applications using "async/await" lead to less software quality?
3. Do JavaScript applications that use "promise" show better software quality?

#### RQ3: "What characteristics influence the frequency of bug patterns of the analyzed JavaScript applications?"
1. Choice of asynchronous programming constructs.
2. Choice of framework.
3. Choice of

## Study Object Selection

- [ ] GitHub as source of open-source repositories and code
- [ ] GitHub API for selecting and downloading code
- [ ] GitHub Search for setting constraints and requirements 

## Sampling Strategy

- [ ] Setting constraints and requirements for selecting repositories
- [ ] Writing sctipt to automate the sampling

### Constraints for repositories

- [ ] the primary programming language should be min. 60% JavaScript (because applications always have content of other languages, like HTML, CSS, XML, or additional backend),
- [ ] a repository is not necessarily a project,
- [ ] must have modified in the last year at least once (to avoid analyzing inactive repositories),
- [ ] must have more than 10,000 lines of code,
- [ ] must have at least ten stars,
- [ ] 

- [ ] Set relevant metrics
  - [ ] a repo is not necessarily a project,
  - [ ] few/more commits,
  - [ ] stars,
  - [ ] contributors,
  - [ ] activity,
  - [ ] period of time,
  - [ ] primary programming language = min. 60% JS (because applications always have content of other languages, like HTML, CSS, XML, or additional backend)
- [ ] How to find asynchronous programming constructs in repos

## Data Collection Procedures

- [ ] Define software quality metrics
- [ ] Which API for extraction data from GitHub

## Analysis Procedures

- [ ] Which tools for analysis
- [ ] Benchmark of tools which to use
- [ ] Advantages and Disadvantages of a tool and their measuring metrics

## Validty Procedures

- [ ] ?
